Launchlab Benefits for Creatives 
================================

Creativity through Collaboration

Design feedback and collaboration between creatives, mentors and clients.

Your creativity and design ideas taken from great to spectacular.

**Delight your clients with beautiful presentations**

Sending a bunch of images or PDF files to your clients won't probably deliver the experience you have in mind. LaunchLab allows you to quickly create profile and portfolio of your designs, so your clients can interact and collaborate on the project efficiently and easily.

**Fill Out a Design Brief**

As a client we make it easy for you to fill out a specified design brief which can be accessed at any time for clarity and confirmation.

**Centralized feedback in context**

No more back and forth emails with lots of design files, endless discussions and Skype meetings. Presenting your design work and receiving feedback from your clients is made easier with LaunchLab.

**No need for 3rd party apps to send deliverables**

After finishing a project, every designer has to send the source files to their clients. Deliver the final project assets with ease via a link and avoid email attachment limitations, spam filters and 3rd party file delivery apps.

**Keep track of your past file versions**

Record the entire history of your projects, even when it comes to the first sketches. When going through multiple design iterations, with LaunchLab you are able to keep record of your past file versions (revisions), so you can get back to a certain point in history or access all your previous discussions.

**Organize your work**

Don't lose your past work, but don't have it stay in your way. Organize your work in a professional and efficient manner so you can focus on what matters most.

**Work as a team**

Feel like you're next to your team mates, wherever they are. Either you're a freelancer or an agency, LaunchLab will work for you. Since everything is real time, you will really feel like working in the same room. Whenever you add a project, create a new link, write a comment, your mentors (as well as your clients) will get to see them instantly.

**Automated Quoting/ Invoicing**

Launchlab covers all the financial administration. No more, having to Quote or Invoice clients. A standard and comprehensive price-List gets published on the LaunchLab's website



Launchlab Benefits for Mentors
==============================

Earn an extra income while you teach and facilitate projects through LaunchLab.



Launchlab Benefits for Clients
==============================

High quality designs, pleasant interaction with your work and a great feedback experience on both sides will build long lasting relationships with happy clients. Showing your work to your clients is as easy as sending them a link. From there on, using a very simple interface, they can access any revisions or add their feedback on each of the project files.

Communication can be difficult sometimes. Clients come to designers with something in mind and they only visualize the final product. We think this is a serious problem, that LaunchLab manages to solve, especially for designers who don't have a project manager by their side. Agencies can also use it and get the same results.

**They will:**

communicate efficiently;

increase productivity; 

get feedback in real time;

organize their work better;

satisfy their customers through their presentations.

**On-line creative / student inventory**
